The Purpose of my portfolio is to get an understanding of who i am, what i offer and how to reach me. it is a why for employers to get insight on me and my capabilties. i have used minimal effects and color in order to reach and clean minimilistic look whilst also adding enough images and text to not make it bland, there are five pages (including main), and many functions, this is my first time building a portfolio so i attempted to make it as clear a readable as posiible, my target audio is for employers/recruiters who wish to know my capabilties and what i can offer so when i was creating it i kept that in mind.

funtions and features that my portfolio provides are
- Buttons that lead to other pages within my website, such as my "learn more" button which if pressed leads to the about page to learn me about me
- my nav bar allows users to click on a page in which they would like to visit in order to gain more information, such as my contact option which leads the user to the page which jas ways to contact me
- The images on the end of the page which are under the "more content" title are functional and allow you to click on them in order to get informtion or text about me
- My porfolio also has scrolable pages which allows for more content to be displayed
- Another functionality is the social bar oon the footer which directs you to the social media platform whichs icon u click on
